# Best Practices

Guidelines for effective development workflows including task management, commit messages, and session protocols.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks about best practices for development
- Creating or reviewing commit messages
- Managing tasks and tracking progress
- Starting or ending a development session
- Discussing code quality standards

## Task Management

### Task Tagging System

Every task in `project/tasks.md` should include status and context:

```markdown
## Task 3: User Authentication
**Status:** in progress
**Priority:** High
**Tags:** #backend #auth #security
**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 2
```

**Standard Tags:**
- **Domain:** `#frontend`, `#backend`, `#database`, `#api`, `#ui`, `#devops`
- **Type:** `#feature`, `#bug`, `#refactor`, `#docs`, `#test`, `#security`
- **Priority:** `#critical`, `#high`, `#medium`, `#low`

### Automatic Updates

Update `project/tasks.md` when:
- Creating a commit → Mark related tasks as in_progress or complete
- User says "done with [task]" → Update status to complete
- User says "starting [task]" → Update status to in_progress
- Build fails → Add note to relevant task with error details

## Commit Workflow

### Smart Commit Messages

When user says "commit", follow this process:

1. **Analyze changes** - What files were modified?
2. **Match to tasks** - Which task does this relate to?
3. **Update tasks** - Mark checkboxes complete
4. **Generate message** - Use conventional commit format

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<detailed description>

Changes:
- [Bullet point of changes]
- [Another change]

Related: Task X
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `docs` - Documentation
- `test` - Tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): implement login form with validation

Add login form component with email/password fields.
Integrate form validation with Zod.
Add error handling and loading states.

Changes:
- Add LoginForm component
- Add validation schema
- Add auth API route

Related: Task 3
```

## Session Protocols

### Session Start

When starting a new session:

1. **Read** `project/tasks.md` to understand current state
2. **Check** `dev-context.md` for in-progress work
3. **Identify** last worked-on task
4. **Ask user** what they want to work on

**Example greeting:**
```
I see you were working on Task 3 (User Authentication).
Last session you completed the login form.

Would you like to continue with the signup flow, or work on something else?
```

### Session End

When user indicates session is ending:

1. **Review** uncommitted changes
2. **Prompt** to commit if work was done
3. **Update** `project/tasks.md` with progress
4. **Update** `dev-context.md` with current state
5. **Suggest** next steps

**Example wrap-up:**
```
Before you go, let me wrap up:

Uncommitted changes:
- Modified: auth.ts, login.tsx
- Added: validation.ts

Would you like to commit these changes?

I'll update tasks.md with today's progress:
- Completed: Login form component
- In progress: Form validation

Next session suggestion: Add error handling and loading states.
```

## Server-First Rendering (No Flash / No Double-Load)

**The #1 UX problem in modern web apps: content flashes, disappears into a skeleton loader, then reappears.** This happens when data that should be server-rendered is instead fetched on the client after the page loads.

### The Rule

**Load data before rendering. Show a skeleton while loading, then render the page once.** The user should never see content appear, vanish into a loading state, then reappear. The correct flow is:

1. User navigates to a page
2. Skeleton/pending state shows **while the server fetches data**
3. Page renders **once** with complete data
4. Done - no second loading state, no flash

The broken flow is:

1. User navigates to a page
2. Server renders an empty shell (or partial content)
3. Client JS loads, fires `useEffect`, shows a skeleton
4. Data comes back, page re-renders with content

**The difference:** In the good pattern, the skeleton shows **before** the page renders. In the bad pattern, the page renders, then **replaces itself** with a skeleton, then renders again.

### What Causes the Double-Load Flash

1. **Using `useEffect` + `useState` for initial data** - Component renders empty, then fetches, then re-renders
2. **Client-side data fetching for server-available data** - Dashboard data, user profile, page content
3. **Wrapping entire pages in Suspense/loading boundaries** - Shows skeleton for the whole page instead of streaming parts
4. **Hydration mismatch** - Server renders one thing, client JS takes over and re-renders differently
5. **Unnecessary client components** - Making a component `'use client'` when it doesn't need interactivity

### The Fix: Load Data Before Rendering

**TanStack Start - Use loaders with pendingComponent, not useEffect:**

```tsx
// BAD - causes double-load flash
function Dashboard() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/dashboard').then(r => r.json()).then(setData);
  }, []);
  if (!data) return <Skeleton />;  // Shows AFTER empty page renders
  return <DashboardContent data={data} />;
}

// GOOD - skeleton shows while loader runs, page renders once
export const Route = createFileRoute('/dashboard')({
  loader: async () => {
    const data = await fetchDashboardData();
    return { data };
  },
  pendingComponent: () => <DashboardSkeleton />,  // Shows BEFORE page renders
  component: Dashboard,
});

function Dashboard() {
  const { data } = Route.useLoaderData();
  return <DashboardContent data={data} />;  // Renders once with complete data
}
```

**Next.js - Use Server Components with Suspense, not client fetching:**

```tsx
// BAD - client component fetching (double-load)
'use client';
function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => { fetchUser().then(setUser); }, []);
  if (!user) return <Skeleton />;
  return <Profile user={user} />;
}

// GOOD - server component with Suspense boundary for loading
import { Suspense } from 'react';

// Parent page
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<ProfileSkeleton />}>
      <UserProfile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// Server component - data loaded before rendering
async function UserProfile() {
  const user = await getUser();
  return <Profile user={user} />;
}
```

**Astro - Already server-first by default:**

```astro
---
// Data fetched at build time - zero client JS, zero loading states
const page = await getPage('homepage');
---
<h1>{page.title}</h1>
```

### Decision Checklist

Before adding a loading state, ask:

1. **Is the loading state in the right place?** It should show BEFORE the page renders, not after
2. **Am I using a loader/server component?** If not, the skeleton will flash
3. **Is the loading state covering data that was already rendered?** If yes, you have a hydration problem
4. **Does this component need client-side interactivity?** If no, keep it server-rendered

### When Loading States ARE Appropriate

- **During navigation** (pendingComponent/Suspense while loader runs)
- **User-triggered actions** (submitting a form, clicking a button)
- **Genuinely slow external APIs** (third-party services that take 3+ seconds)
- **Infinite scroll / pagination** (loading more content)
- **Real-time data updates** (polling, WebSocket)
- **Below-the-fold content** (lazy load with Intersection Observer)

### When Client-Side Fetching is NOT Appropriate

- **Initial page data** (dashboard stats, user profile, page content) - use loaders
- **Data that's available in the database** (query it in the loader, not in useEffect)
- **Auth-gated content** (check auth in beforeLoad/middleware, not after render)

### Caching: Skeleton Only on First Visit

The skeleton should only appear on the **first** navigation to a page. Returning to the same page should be instant from cache.

- **TanStack Start:** Set `staleTime` on route loaders to cache data. Use `<Link preload="intent">` to prefetch on hover. See `framework/tanstack-start` skill for details.
- **Astro:** Static HTML means zero loading states. Enable View Transitions + prefetching for SPA-like instant navigation. See `framework/astro` skill.
- **Next.js:** Use `fetch()` with `revalidate` in Server Components, or React Query with `staleTime` on the client.

### Key Principle

**Skeletons are good. Skeletons that replace already-rendered content are the problem.** Always load data in loaders/server components so the skeleton shows during navigation, not after the page has already painted. Cache the data so the skeleton only shows once.

## Code Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Checks

Before allowing commit, verify:

- [ ] No console.log statements (unless approved)
- [ ] No TODO comments without issue reference
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Related task checkboxes updated
- [ ] Run `npx ultracite fix` for linting

### Quality Standards

- **TypeScript** - Use proper types, avoid `any`
- **Error handling** - Handle error cases appropriately
- **Naming** - Follow existing conventions in codebase
- **Simplicity** - Don't over-engineer solutions

## Pattern Detection

### When to Document Patterns

Suggest creating documentation when:
- Same code pattern used 3+ times
- New technology added to project
- Performance optimization discovered
- Security fix applied

**Example suggestion:**
```
I notice you're using this API pattern repeatedly.
Should I document it in the relevant skill file for consistency?
```

## Progress Tracking

### Velocity Awareness

Track informally:
- Tasks completed per session
- Blockers encountered
- Estimation accuracy

### Lessons Learned

After completing complex tasks, note:
- What worked well
- What took longer than expected
- Patterns to reuse

## Quick Commands

Users can say:
- "status" → Show current task status
- "next" → Suggest next task
- "commit" → Create commit with proper message
- "wrap up" → End session protocol
- "blockers" → List blocked tasks

## Key Principles

1. **Proactive updates** - Update tasks as you work, not just at the end
2. **Clear commits** - Each commit should be self-documenting
3. **Context preservation** - Always update dev-context for in-progress work
4. **Pattern consistency** - Check existing code before creating new patterns
5. **Simplicity** - Don't over-engineer, keep solutions focused
